    "# Description of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to decide where to open warehouses to serve a customers located in four possible locations. The three possible locations are Harlingen, Memphis and Ashland. The four customer locations are NYC, LA, Chitown and Houston.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance (cost) between the candidate locations and customer locations are given in the following table\n",
    "\n",
    "|  | NYC | LA | Chicago | Houston         \n",
    "| :---:|:---: | :---:|:---:|:---:\n",
    "| Harlingen|1956|1606|1410|330\n",

    "\n",
    "You have the decide where to open warehouses such that to minimize the cost of shipping while respecting some constraints. For instance, all customers must be served and you cannot open more than two warehouses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "0. How many warehouses do you open?\n",
    "1. Where are you going to location your warehouse(s)?\n",
    "2. Who ships to whom?\n",
    "3. What is the optimum?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling\n",
    "This problem is known as the p-median problem, see for instance https://optimization.mccormick.northwestern.edu/index.php/Facility_location_problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical formulation of the problem is as follows. Let $x_{n,m}$ be the fraction of demand for customer $m$ that is served by warehouse $n$. For each warehouse $n$, the cost of delivering the product to customer $m$ is given by $d_{n,m}$. The binary variables $y_n$ are used to define whether or not a warehouse should be built, where $y_n=1$ when wharehouse $n$ is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function is thus:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{min}_{x,y}\\quad \\sum_{n=1}^3\\sum_{m=1}^{4}  d_{n,m}\\times x_{n,m}\n",

    "s.t.\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sum_{n=1}^{3}x_{n,m}&= 1\\quad \\forall m\\\\\n",
    "x_{n,m}& \\leq y_n\\quad \\forall n,m\\\\\n",
