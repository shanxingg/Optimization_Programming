    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "What is the optimal ad placement policy that maximizes the click-through revenues while meeting the contractual obligations?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define decision variables:\n",
    "Let $i={1,2,3,4}$ be in the index for the advertisers such that\n",
    "* $i=1$ is GEICO\n",
    "* $i=2$ is Delta\n",
    "* $i=3$ is T-Mobile\n",
    "* $i=4$ is Capital One\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $j={1,2}$ be the index for the category, such as $j=1$ is the Sports categorty and $j=2$ is the National category.\n",
    "\n",
    "So $x_{11}$ is the number of impressions for Geico in Sports and $x_{12}$ is the number of impressions for GEICO in the National category.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define objective function:\n",
    "The objective of the platform, i.e., Washington Post, is to maximize advertising revenues. These revenues are driven by the cost per click charged to the advertisers, i.e., \\$2.4 and the click-through rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\kappa_{ij}$ be the CTR of advertiser $i$ in category $j$. For instance, the CTR of T-Mobile in the sports category is $\\kappa_{31}=1.0\\%$, whereas its CTR in the National category is $\\kappa_{32}=3.0\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function is thus:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Objective=2.4\\times \\sum_{i=1}^4\\sum_{j=1}^{2}  \\kappa_{ij}\\times x_{ij}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define constraints:\n",
    "The first table provides the following constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x_{11}&\\geq 2,000,000\\\\\n",
    "x_{12}&\\geq 1,000,000\\\\\n",
    "x_{22}&\\geq 1,000,000\\\\\n",
    "x_{21}+x_{22}&\\geq 2,000,000\\\\\n",
    "x_{31}&\\geq 1,000,000\\\\\n",
    "x_{32}&\\geq 1,000,000\\\\\n",
    "x_{31}+x_{32}&\\geq 3,000,000\\\\\n",
    "x_{41}+x_{42}&\\geq 2,000,000\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Assume that the Sports section gets six million views per day and the National section\n",
    "get five million views per day\"\n",
    "This statement gives two constraints:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{4}x_{i1}&\\leq 6,000,000\\\\\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{4}x_{i2}&\\leq 5,000,000\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-negativity constraints are\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "x_{ij}\\geq 0\n",

    "The profit summation of plant A and plant B (220+165=385) is less than the profit of joint optimization of plant A and B(400). This happens because we set a limitation of row material on each plant. When we remove this limitation, we can now better take use of all(and allocate) row material. In other word, the optimal profit will increase with the decrease in limitation. In this case, we use the \"wasted\" row material from plant A, to add to the needed row material that producing additional one deluxe product in plant B, to reach higher joint profit. Hence, the additional 15 profit(400-385=15) is from one additional deluxe product producing in plant B."
